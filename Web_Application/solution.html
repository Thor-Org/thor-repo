                        <p style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;This page explores that problem in more detail so that you may better understand the problem that the Project Thor team is trying to solve. This page assumes no immense technical background in computing or cybersecurity, but will explore the problem in some detail.</p>
                        <h3 class="text-start" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);">Background</h3>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">In order to understand the problem, you must first understand some of the technical background of using random numbers in computing. This section explains in simple and nontechnical terms a working definition of randomness, how randomness in computing is obtained, and how that randomness is used.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">To begin, let's define the working definition of randomness as it applies to cryptography. In most fields, a process or set of numbers is considered "random" if it possesses certain statistical properties or characteristics. For example, the digits of pi may be said to be random because all sequences of numbers appear with equal frequency. However, in the field of cryptography, random means unpredictable. That is, a process for generating random numbers is secure if an attacker (be it man or machine) is unable to predict the next number with greater than 50% accuracy. The problem lies in the processes that we use to obtain unpredictable randomness.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">Currently, there are two common approaches that computer scientists use to obtain unpredictable randomness. The first is believed to produce true randomness, while the second produces pseudo (artificial) randomness.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">True randomness comes not from computers, but rather the real world. Its unpredictability relies on the inherent unpredictability or inaccuracy of a physical process or measurement of a physical process respectively. For example, consider radioactive decay and quantum mechanics. Both the of these physical processes are considered to be inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we can use them as sources of randomness. Now, consider measuring the temperature of chicken with a common kitchen meat thermometer. Here, we draw unpredictability not from the thing that we are measuring, but rather from the inaccuracy of the least significant bits of the measurement. more specifically, in our example we can expect (or predict) that the thermometer will measure the temperature of your chicken quite accurately and consistently to three whole numbers every time. But what if you tried to take a more precise measurement by examining the next few decimal places? The thermometer itself if not the precise so the measurements produced won't always come out the same. You may get 165.123, 165.132, 165.489 and so on. It's these decimal numbers that we consider inherently unpredictable.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">However, the process of obtaining these truly random numbers is expensive and slow. Additionally, computers can consume them faster than they are gathered. The solution is to use pseudorandom numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are generated through the use of deterministic algorithms that take a random number as a seed and produce a far larger amount of random numbers as output. These algorithms, used in cryptography, are commonly known as cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRGNs). What's important to understand about a CSPRNG is that if the seed value that is passed into it is unpredictable (comes from a truly random source), then the algorithm preserves that unpredictability in its output.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">Finally, one more thing you must understand is that in most computer operating systems there is an entropy pool. - a collection of randomness that is believed to be secure - that is used to seed a CSPRNG. This entropy pool is usually updated from a source of true randomness such as precise measurements of the timing between keystrokes on a keyboard, IDE timing, or mouse movements.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3 class="text-start" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);">The problem</h3>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">Now that you have a basic understanding of where randomness in computing is obtained and used, we will introduce you to some of the current problems that this process has in regards to the security of the random data and in turn there cryptography algorithms that use it.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">One of the biggest areas of concern with using natural phenomena as a source of true randomness to seed an entropy pool is that the source of randomness may be too predictable. When choosing a source of randomness from the world it is nearly impossible to prove that source is unpredictable. Generally, the scientific community attempts to disprove a source as unpredictable and after many failed attempts they reach the general conclusion that it isn't predictable. However, this is far from a verified, validated, and peer reviewed proof. it is potentially foreseeable that an attacker using new technologies and methods may be able to distinguish predictable patterns in a source that is only understood, but not proven to be unpredictable. For example, consider earthquakes and how unpredictable they used to be before computer were around. Now, with computers, scientists have been able to take data that they have gathered about earthquakes and use machine learning processes to model and predict future earthquake's location, intensity, and potential damages. Now, if computers use any of those factors as their source of true entropy, they would be at great risk of attack.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">Another area of concern is an attacker may have or be able to gain access to the sources of unpredictable randomness that computers are using, thus being able to observe and begin finding ways to make prediction about them. Therefore, it is desirable that whatever source you use isn't easily accessible by attackers. However, at the same time it must be easily accessible by computers. This issue alone can be a great challenge.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">Finally, the last big concern is an attacker could have or find a way to manipulate the source or randomness and influence what may have once been unpredictable values into now predictable values.</p>
                        <h3 class="text-start" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);">project Thor</h3>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">A common approach to addressing these issues is known as randomness mixing. This approach makes use of a cool property of random values. Basically, if two or more random sources's results are mixed together, then the resulting set of values is at least as unpredictable as either of the inputs. What this means is that if you mix a set of values that is highly unpredictable with one that may be somewhat predictable, then the results will be a highly unpredictable set of values.</p>
                        <p class="text-center" style="color: var(--bs-body-color);font-size: 16px;">The Project Thor team hopes to capitalize on this approach by offering a different more unique source of randomness that may be mixed with other sources through randomness mixing in an attempt to help diversify the sources of randomness used to seed CSPRNGs making them more secure.</p>
